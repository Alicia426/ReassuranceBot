Hello, I am ReassuranceBot, you can call me Res. 

I respond to the following instructions:

    - !help => Display this message.
    - !configure => Tell me you preferred name and pronouns so I remember. 
                    Example: `!configure Eli they/them/theirs`
                    If you change your discord handle, you will have to tell me again.
    - !config_stuffie => Tell me your stuffie's name and pronouns so I remember. 
                    Example: `!config_stuffie Bear she/her/hers`
                    If you change your discord handle, you will have to tell me again.
                    If you change pronouns and preferred name, run `!configure` again
                    and I will update them.
    - !hello => I say hi and confirm I am ok.
    - !reassure => I give you a reassuring message, because you are not alone.
                    Can be given the `--stuffie` flag to reassure your friend too.
