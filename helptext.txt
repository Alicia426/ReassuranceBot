Hello, I am ReassuranceBot, you can call me Res. 
I respond to the following instructions:

    - !configure => Tell me you preferred name and pronouns so I remember. 
                    Example: `!configure Eli they/them/theirs/themself`
                    If you change your discord handle, you will have to tell me again.
                    If you change pronouns and preferred name, run `!configure` again
                    and I will update them.
                    Please fill out all four pronoun slots, with slashes in between, 
                    otherwise i might get my grammar mixed up.

    - !reassure => I give you a reassuring message, because you are not alone.
                    Can be given the `--stuffie` flag to reassure your friend too.
                    Examples: `!reassure --stuffie`, `!reassure`
    - !advice => I give you a piece of advice from my mother Alicia.
    - !butter => I pass you butter, cry, and recite an ancient text.
